Thirteen years after it entered the competition for Indian Air Force (IAF)â€™s Medium Multi Role Combat Aircraft (MMRCA), and eight years after it won the competition, the first batch of five Rafale fighters landed at Ambala airbase on 29 July. These will re-equip Ambala-based 17 squadron and it will become the first Rafale squadron of IAF. The second squadron will be based at Hashimara air base, close to Bhutan border, in east. IAF has taken delivery of ten of the contracted thirty-six Rafale. Five have come to Ambala. The other five will stay in France for training and will come to India later. Delivery of all thirty-six Rafale will be completed by end-2021.

Rafale can be used as air superiority fighter with Beyond Visual Range (BVR) missiles and close combat missiles (CCM) to attack targets in the air, or to attack targets on ground or sea with precision-guided munitions, or for reconnaissance, or in nuclear strike role with stand-off cruise missile.
